ACT I. Scene I.
Against the which a moiety competent
And carriage of the article design'd,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And I am sick at heart.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And will not let belief take hold of him
As it doth well appear unto our state,
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
Ber. He.
Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Ber. I have seen nothing.
Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Ber. It would be spoke to.
Ber. Last night of all,
Ber. Long live the King!
Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
Ber. Say-
Ber. See, it stalks away!
Ber. Sit down awhile,
Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
Ber. Well, good night.
Ber. Who's there.?
Bernardo, officer.
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
Claudius, King of Denmark.
Cornelius, courtier.
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
English Ambassadors.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
Exit Ghost.
For food and diet, to some enterprise
(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.
Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
Fran. Bernardo?
Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
Fran. Give you good night.
Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
Francisco, a soldier
Getrude, Queen of Denmark, mother to Hamlet.
Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
Give you good night.
Guildenstern, courtier.
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Hor. A piece of him.
Hor. As thou art to thyself.
Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
Hor. Friends to this ground.
Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Hor. That can I.
Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Hor. Well, sit we down,
Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Laertes, son to Polonius.
Lords, ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, Attendants.
Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Mar. Is it not like the King?
Mar. It is offended.
Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
Mar. Question it, Horatio.
Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
Reynaldo, servant to Polonius.
Rosencrantz, courtier.
SCENE.- Elsinore.
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Such was the very armour he had on
That are so fortified against our story,
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
That, if again this apparition come,
The bell then beating one-
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Therefore I have entreated him along,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
'Tis strange.
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Together with that fair and warlike form
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Two Clowns, gravediggers.
Voltemand, courtier.
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What think you on't?
What we two nights have seen.
What, is Horatio there ?
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is't that can inform me?
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why this same strict and most observant watch
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
Without the sensible and true avouch
