And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And will not let belief take hold of him

He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

SCENE.- Elsinore.
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Such was the very armour he had on
That are so fortified against our story,
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
That, if again this apparition come,
The bell then beating one-
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Therefore I have entreated him along,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
'Tis strange.
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Together with that fair and warlike form
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Two Clowns, gravediggers.
Voltemand, courtier.
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What think you on't?
What we two nights have seen.
What, is Horatio there ?
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is't that can inform me?
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why this same strict and most observant watch
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
Without the sensible and true avouch
